# valuesplan

ValuesPlan is a self-contained decision-support application, developed to support environmental managers with decision-making within the values-driven management framework ([Wallace, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2011.12.001)). The application allows users to describe the parameters of a management system, and explore how human value delivery will be affected if the state of the system changes. Due to their strength in dealing with linguistic data, the application uses a non-singleton fuzzy system to model the relationships between input and output variables.

The application is split into two primary areas; the Project Creation section and the Project Analysis section.

## Project Creation

Within this section, users can being to define a management system. The application can currently model information concerning:
- System elements (e.g. seahorse species, water body).
- Element properties (e.g. population size, height).
- Human values (e.g. meaningful occupation, recreational enjoyment).
- Connections between element properties and human values within the system.
- Fuzzy set parameters relating to input variables

## Project Analysis

Within this section, users can describe the current state of a management system and view the predicted output deliveries for human values. Input parameters can be described by crisp or interval values.
